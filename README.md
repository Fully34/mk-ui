#### Install

You can copy the files directly from this repo OR (recommended) you can install this project as a node module using npm. Using NPM is ideal for easy updates. It also *will not* give you the enire project. Doing an install gives you the JavaScript, Less, SCSS, and CSS assets for Mk-Ui only. So don't worry about the install being bulky, it aint.

```bash
npm install mk-ui
```
